                        <p>I stumbled upon the online FU certificate because I needed a program that was fully asynchronous due to my full-time job. Since this was my first foray into online instruction, I was a bit hesitant. I’m happy to report that I couldn’t have made a better choice! In fact, the courses were so thorough that I decided to enroll in the MEd program after completing the certificate. The faculty were knowledgeable, approachable, and quite skillful at leveraging the online nature of the program. I can honestly say that FU changed my career path completely: in a few months, I’ll be starting a PhD program in educational measurement at FU. Two years ago, that never would have been an option!</p>

                        <p>"I am a doctoral student in the Department of Special Education at FU. I was originally interested in increasing my knowledge of statistics so I applied for the ERM certificate. I was so impressed by the level of support and structure the online courses and professors offered, though, that I decided to pursue the MEd MESA degree. I am so thankful to be part of this program. I have learned so much and cannot imagine reading, let alone conducting, research without the skills I have learned through this program.”</p>
